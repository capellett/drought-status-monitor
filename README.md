# drought-status-monitor
A shiny app for reporting surface water drought metrics.

Be sure the packages in global.R are installed on your computer to run the app.

The reservoir data from Duke Energy is scraped off of their page using phantomjs.

Install that from phantomjs.org and save the .exe file in the dukeScrape/ folder if you want to use that part of the app.

The first time you run the app, it will take some time to download the data and calculate metrics.
